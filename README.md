# Breast-Cancer-Detection-
Using SVM and KNN classifiers to correctly identify tumours in breast cancer patients

This project is from the 'Machine learning for Healthcare' by Eduonix Learning. It was helpful to explore the role of machine learning in tumour detection and get to grips with techniques including: 

1. Detecting breast cancer with SVM and KNN aglorithms
2. Data visulisation with machine learning
3. Training models and making predictions
4. Exploring the relationship between precicion and recall
